# New ESP board

Upload this script to a new ESP8266 or ESP32 to gather the information on the hardware and WiFi connection.
The script starts a webserver. Open the webpage with your browser.

The script also runs the OTA (Over-The-Air) service, which enables you to replace the code with your own code over-the-air.

To use: Add your SSID and password in a secrets.h file (example available) or change the main.cpp
